# The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

Some of my [past experiments](https://github.com/jeffbinder/visions-and-revisions) with text generation have taken inspiration from the Romantic poet [William Blake](http://www.blakearchive.org/). Continuing this engagement, I have designed some Boolean prompts inspired by Blake's 1790 book [The Marriage of Heaven and Hell](http://www.blakearchive.org/work/mhh).

Unsurprisingly, GPT-2 is capable of generating descriptions of Heaven and Hell. Here are some examples of each, with the prompts in bold.

While the "or" operator usually produces a description of one or the other, the "and" operator finds strange middle grounds. Here are ten examples:
